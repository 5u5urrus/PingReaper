# ICMP Information Check (`icmp_information_check`)

## Opening Scenario

While scanning an outdated industrial control network, a tester sends an obscure ICMP packet rarely used since the early days of the internet. To their surprise, an old router responds — revealing not just that it’s alive, but that it’s running a decades-old firmware untouched by security patches.

## What This Test Is

The ICMP Information Request/Reply feature was originally intended for a host to learn basic network information when other discovery mechanisms were unavailable.

* **Type 15** — Information Request
* **Type 16** — Information Reply

This mechanism has been **deprecated** for decades and is almost never used in modern networks.

## Why This Matters

* A response to this request is a strong indicator of outdated or legacy systems.
* May point to unmaintained devices that could have a wide range of unpatched vulnerabilities.
* Useful for fingerprinting — very few modern systems reply, making it a high-signal detection method.

## How It Works

A Type 15 packet is sent to the target.
If the target supports and responds to this deprecated request, it sends back a Type 16 reply.
The mere existence of the reply is the finding — the data in it is rarely useful, but the fact that the system answered is significant.

## Realistic Scenarios

1. **Legacy System Discovery** – During a security review of a manufacturing plant, an ICMP Information Request elicits a reply from a forgotten network appliance running firmware from 2001. This instantly flags it for priority patching and isolation.

2. **Target Prioritization** – In a mixed network, a red team identifies only three devices responding to ICMP Type 15. These become primary targets for further exploitation, knowing they likely run older, less secure stacks.

## Defensive Recommendations

* Block ICMP Types 15 and 16 at network perimeters.
* Identify and upgrade or isolate systems that respond to these requests.
* Use modern, secure methods for network discovery and configuration.
